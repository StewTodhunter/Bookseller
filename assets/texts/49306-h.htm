<h2>THE HOLY ISLE.<br />
A Legend of Bardsey Abbey.</h2>
<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">watched</span> the sea
waves ebbing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath the crimson glow,<br />
Which sunset light was pouring,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon their soft, sweet flow.<br />
The wavelets looked liked dancers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the sun-lit sea,<br />
They sung in whispering chorus,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought they sung to me<br />
Of fair and far off landscapes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond that molten tide,<br />
Of better joys, and gladness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond those waters wide.<br />
<a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>The wavelets
all seemed passing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On, to some other strands,<br />
And following the sun&rsquo;s-glow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To ever sun-lit lands.<br />
But as I thought these fancies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Again I raised mine eyes<br />
And saw the sunset tinting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The glorious western skies.<br />
Now &rsquo;mid the farewell glories<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Of Sol&rsquo;s departing ray,&rdquo;<br />
I saw an Island resting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon his golden way.<br />
There, misty mid the Sunshine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The far off Isle appears,<br />
Right out among the sea waves<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its rocky coast uprears.<br />
And as I gaze, the sunset<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seems lighting up its shore,<br />
Bathing the isle in glory<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then is seen no more.<br />
<a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>Sweet,
soothing calm fell o&rsquo;er me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I watched the Islet still,<br />
All round me heard I voices<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which seemed the air to fill.<br />
Said one, &ldquo;That Isle is holy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For Saints are sleeping there,<br />
Now lonely and deserted,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; T&rsquo;was once an Isle of prayer.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;O Man! say would&rsquo;st thou tremble,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To come away and see,<br />
In vision, strange, sweet pictures<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which I can shew to thee?&rdquo;<br />
The Angel was so lovely,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So sweet the Angel&rsquo;s smile,<br />
I easily consented,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He pointed to the Isle!<br />
&ldquo;Then will I bear thee thither,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One thousand years ago;&mdash;<br />
I speak to aid thy weakness,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No <i>time</i> can Angels know.<br />
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>The present,
past, and future,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All one they are to me,<br />
I pass along their boundaries,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlimited, and free.&rdquo;<br />
A strange, calm change stole o&rsquo;er me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My spirit seemed to rise<br />
In gentle, tireless motion,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the sea-bird flies.<br />
My Angel-guide was leading<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My spirit o&rsquo;er the sea<br />
One moment&mdash;and we rested,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the Islet&rsquo;s lea.<br />
Soft gloaming filled the air,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep peace lay all around,<br />
Hushed voices seemed to whisper,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A wavelike, murmuring sound.<br />
&ldquo;Sweet Angel, say, where am I,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Say me the Island&rsquo;s name,<br />
And tell me why such glory,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Enwraps it as a flame?<br />
<a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Say, too,
what is that chanting,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So sweet, so very near,<br />
The strangeness of this beauty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It fills my soul with fear?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;This Holy Place is Bardsey,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus, He loves it well,<br />
&rsquo;Tis wrapped in God&rsquo;s own brightness,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Safe from the power of Hell.<br />
Those voices are the Virgins,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In yonder Abbey Choir,<br />
Praises to Jesus singing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of which they never tire.<br />
Hush! mid the shades of evening,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How restfully they sing,<br />
Their Vesper praise-wreaths bringing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To Jesus Christ their King.<br />
&rsquo;Mid lights of sunset glowing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; St. Mary&rsquo;s Abbey stands;<br />
But see! t&rsquo;is wrapped in glories,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From far off better Lands.&rdquo;<br />
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>I looked
again, and started,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For lo! another scene.<br />
The Convent is surrounded<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With Heaven&rsquo;s own brightest sheen.<br />
And choirs of Angels hover<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; High in the sunset air,<br />
While th&rsquo; holy monks are chanting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their peaceful, evening prayer.<br />
The Monastery is glowing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like heaps of molten gold;<br />
The walls seem all transparent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With majesty untold.<br />
T&rsquo;is strange; my spirit enters<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; St Mary&rsquo;s Sacred Shrine,<br />
I see the cowl&egrave;d figures,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In many a white rob&rsquo;d line, <a
name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6"
class="citation">[6]</a><br />
<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>Filling the
stalls, but facing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The hallow&rsquo;d Altar Throne,<br />
Where Jesus makes His dwelling,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Untended and alone.<br />
O peaceful, happy Bardsey,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet Islet of the Sea!<br />
I would for ever rest me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All joyfully in thee!<br />
O dear St. Marys Abbey,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On Bardsey&rsquo;s northern shore;<br />
Would I could bide within thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And part from thee no more!<br />
O happy Monks and Virgins,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Singing by night and day,<br />
Your hymnals to Sweet Jesus,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In dearest, fondest lay!<br />
How can I speak your glory,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I tell your worth?<br />
Ye are the Church&rsquo;s safeguard;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye are the &ldquo;Salt of earth.&rdquo;<br />
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Ye live the
life of Angels;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye never cease from praise,<br />
To Heaven your intercedings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For sinners ceaseless raise.<br />
Ah! well may throngs of sinners<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seek this most Sacred Isle,<br />
Well may ten thousand pilgrims<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Visit St. Mary&rsquo;s pile.<br />
Well may&rsquo;st thou, Aberdaron, <a name="citation8"></a><a
href="#footnote8" class="citation">[8]</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Loving to Bardsey be,<br />
And daily turn thy glances<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the Islet out at sea.<br />
For Bardsey is the lighthouse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of many a shipwrecked soul;<br />
To many a way-worn wanderer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Bardsey&rsquo;s Isle the goal.<br />
<a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>The glow of
Bardsey&rsquo;s brightness,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Illumes wild Cambria&rsquo;s shores,<br />
Across the Irish Channel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her Heavenly light she pours.<br />
And blessed saints in thousands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have dwelt on Bardsey&rsquo;s hill,<br />
Sending her countless Virgins<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Celestial choirs to fill.<br />
How Jesus must love Bardsey,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And prize her sacred soil;<br />
Here Saints in countless numbers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have rested from earth&rsquo;s toil:<br />
Have laid aside the burden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of poor mortality,<br />
And entered on the Sabbath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of glad eternity.<br />
While thus I dream, the Organ<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is pealing forth its wave,<br />
The Holy Monks are marching<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All slowly down the Nave.<br />
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>&ldquo;Dear Angel! may I follow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Them, down the Cloister still,<br />
And join their recreation,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On yonder mossy hill?&rdquo;<br />
The Angel smiled permission;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I willed myself along,<br />
Until unseen, I joined me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To th&rsquo; happy, Virgin throng.<br />
Here, there were boys most lovely;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And there, old hoary men;<br />
And youths, and those of mid-age;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here joyous boys again.<br />
I followed one young novice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who held an old man&rsquo;s hand;<br />
I listened,&mdash;they were speaking,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of some dear, distant Land.<br />
The boy I saw was pointing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Away, right out to sea,<br />
Where moonlight made a pathway,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of silver radiancy.<br />
<a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>The silver
way seemed joining<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Together sea and sky,<br />
The stars seemed trembling o&rsquo;er it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like lightlets from on high.<br />
&ldquo;Dear Father Cadfan, look now,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;Said the bright and lovely boy,&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that silver roadway<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Leads to our Home of Joy.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;No, no, my Son, t&rsquo;is only<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An emblem of the way,<br />
Across time&rsquo;s changing storm-tide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To regions of the day.&rdquo;<br />
And then the old man turning,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Towards Cambria&rsquo;s rock bound shore,<br />
Pointed the boy to Barmouth, <a name="citation11"></a><a
href="#footnote11" class="citation">[11]</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But then called Abermawr.<br />
<a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>&ldquo;My
son,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis yonder,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Long years ago I tried<br />
To bring poor souls to Jesus,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who once for sinners died.<br />
But there the Druids held them<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In error&rsquo;s iron chain, <a
name="citation12a"></a><a href="#footnote12a"
class="citation">[12a]</a><br />
They would not hear of Jesus,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And drove me thence again.<br />
Yet though at Abermawr I failed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Mid Towyn&rsquo;s marshes drear, <a
name="citation12b"></a><a href="#footnote12b"
class="citation">[12b]</a><br />
The people bowed before the Cross,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sought the Saviour dear.<br />
My son, one day thou must away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If Father Abbot wills,<br />
And build a Shrine to Christ Divine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Mid Barmouth&rsquo;s rocky hills.<br />
<a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>The idols
which they worship<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou boldly must destroy,<br />
Promise old Father Cadfan this,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My brave, my darling boy!&rdquo;<br />
The boy&rsquo;s bright eyes were flashing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He grasped the old man&rsquo;s hand,&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Father, I will preach Jesus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon that darkened strand.<br />
Only, my father, pray for me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When thou hast past the sea,<br />
And reignest with our Jesus,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the &lsquo;kingdom of the free.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br
/>
St. Cadfan smiled, and blessed the lad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His heart&rsquo;s desire seemed gained,<br />
From idol worship for the Lord<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Should Abermawr be claimed.<br />
The Compline Bell tolled solemnly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From out St. Mary&rsquo;s Tower,<br />
Calling the Monks to worship<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At day&rsquo;s last hallowed hour.<br />
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Dubritius,

&nbsp;&nbsp; Stood meekly in his stall,<br />
The fathers and the novices<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Chanted the Office all.<br />
But Father Cadfan was not there,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Calmly his body lay;<br />
Upon the mound by Bardsey Sound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His spirit passed away.<br />
His work was done, his prize was won,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The holy Monk was gone,<br />
To join the virgin song notes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before th&rsquo; Eternal Throne.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p class="poetry">The boy, so beautiful and pure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Grew up to manhood&rsquo;s bloom,<br />
And ofttimes visited for prayer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Blessed Cadfan&rsquo;s Tomb.<br />
<a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>One night
the sun was sinking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind the Western wave,<br />
Dubritius was kneeling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beside St. Cadfan&rsquo;s grave.<br />
The Compline chants were over,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The twilight almost gone,<br />
The youth was startled by a voice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which cried&mdash;&ldquo;My son! my son!&rdquo;<br
/>
A gentle light shone round the grave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He raised his eyes, and lo!<br />
St. Cadfan stood beside him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Amid the weird-like glow;<br />
&ldquo;My son, make haste, thy solemn vows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou speedily must make,<br />
Then to the men of Abermawr<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Cross of Jesus take.<br />
The Banner and the Gospel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With holy Chant and Psalm,<br />
Straight to the Druid&rsquo;s Temple go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor fear, nor feel alarm.<br />
<a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>For Jesus
must be Cambria&rsquo;s God,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The night must hie away,<br />
Thyself must be the harbinger<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Everlasting Day.&rdquo;<br />
The youth sprung forward to embrace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The friend he loved so well,<br />
But he was gone; no sound was heard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Save the lone ocean&rsquo;s swell.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p class="poetry">How beautiful! how beautiful!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is now the Convent Choir;<br />
All deck&rsquo;d for some high festival<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In exquisite attire.<br />
Most precious gems are gleaming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the frontal fair,<br />
The Mass Priests too are vested<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In garments passing rare.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Some sweet&mdash;some wedding song!<br />

Are bending down their petals,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; T&rsquo;wards a novice bow&rsquo;d in prayer.<br />
Yes! there before the Altar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I see Dubritius bow,<br />
Pure as the virgin lilies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Encircling his fair brow.<br />
His vows are said&mdash;the Cowl is given,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His live-long promise made;<br />
All earthly loves are buried now,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the Cloister&rsquo;s shade.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Unfurl the sail! unloose the chain!<br

To our own precious Island home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which we may see no more!&rdquo;<br />
<a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Thus spake
Dubritius; and the tide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fast wafted him away,<br />
Out t&rsquo;wards the rocky Cambrian coast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Cardigan&rsquo;s fair bay.<br />
The sea was calmly resting,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lit by the summer&rsquo;s sun;<br />
In three short hours the Convent boat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her little voyage had run.<br />
Dubritius and his monkish band<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At once pursued their way,<br />
Reaching the town of Abermawr<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Just at the close of day.<br />
The evening&rsquo;s hush was resting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So peacefully around,<br />
Alone was heard the shrill sea bird,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the waves&rsquo; soft murmuring sound.<br />
When all at once through th&rsquo; restful air,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dread shrieks of anguish rung<br />
From the idol temple near the town,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While Druid choirs sung<br />
<a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Fierce
hymns to their false savage gods,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the kindling flame,<br />
Prepared for sacrificial rites,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Too terrible to name.<br />
A fair young mother brings her babe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A warrior brings his boy,<br />
The Druids bind their victims<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With fierce, fanatic joy!<br />
The weeping mother hears the wail<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Well from her darling&rsquo;s breast;<br />
The father sees the Druids bind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His boy with savage zest.<br />
The lad was fair to look upon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah! must he really die,<br />
Oh! shall such sacrifice pollute<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That calm blue evening sky?<br />
The boy, though brave, is trembling now,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He nears the dreadful fire,<br />
He feels its scorch, yet gives his life,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To still the idol&rsquo;s ire.<br />
<a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>The
father&rsquo;s cheek grows blanched and pale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The poor young mother stands,<br />
Yearning to snatch her precious one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the stern Druid&rsquo;s hands.<br />
High leaps the flame, loud swells the song,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Druids&rsquo; choirs around;<br />
But suddenly the evening wind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fills with another sound!<br />
&rsquo;Tis &ldquo;Miserere Domine,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sung by the Monkish train,<br />
&ldquo;Exurgat Deus Dominus,&rdquo; <a name="citation20"></a><a
href="#footnote20" class="citation">[20]</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A grand and glorious strain!<br />
With Crucifix and banner bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The bold brave monks appear;<br />
And then among the heathen crowd,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ&rsquo;s mighty Cross they rear.<br />
<a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Dubritius spoke, and seized the boy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Straight from the altar&rsquo;s side;<br />
And caught the infant from the flame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or ere the darling died!<br />
While this was done, some novices<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had hurl&rsquo;d the idol down;<br />
&ldquo;Jesus is God!&rdquo; the Monks proclaim,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Your King with homage crown!<br />

To Jesus Christ, and Him alone,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; The power of Jesus&rsquo; Name<br />

Valiant in battle&mdash;bravely<br />

ofttimes &rsquo;mid the strife-clang,<br />

When all at once he altered,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He laid his armour by,<br />
He said, his eyes were opened<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To see earth&rsquo;s vanity.<br />
Eternity seemed opening<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her vista to his view,<br />
He trembled at the prospect,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Graver he daily grew.<br />
Men tried their skill all vainly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To dissipate his fear;<br />
But Rudolph only answered&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Eternity is near!<br />
They say this life is joyous,<br />

Within her bower she waiteth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes with weeping sore,<br />
They cannot stay her sorrow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She mourneth more and more.<br />
&ldquo;Go, tell her,&rdquo; said young Rudolph,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Go, tell the lady fair,<br />
That I have found a Lover,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Beauty wondrous rare.<br />
Yes, tell her He is chiefest<br />

Whose Beauty all the Angels<br />

But Rudolph, list! she pineth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, canst thou break her heart?<br />
Wilt thou prove false to Mabel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So cruelly thus part?<br />
Her rosy blush is waning,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her cheek is growing pale,<br />
Her maiden heart is breaking,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon will her young life fail.<br />
As Rudolph listened, tear drops<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flashed in his dark blue eye,<br />
His manly breast was heaving<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A deep, a piercing sigh.<br />
Oh! tell her, brother, tell her,<br />

Close to the Monks&rsquo; procession,<br />

The Compline Bell was tolling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its last dear Compline call,<br />
To-morrow death-like ruin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would o&rsquo;er the Convent fall.<br />
That night the holy Fathers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Held consultation long,<br />
And all agreed&mdash;Surrender<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would be unjust and wrong.<br />
&ldquo;Then die we at God&rsquo;s Altar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sooner than yield the right<br />
Which God Himself has given us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To sacrilegious might.&rdquo;<br />
And true to their confession<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The holy Monks remained,<br />
And with their virgin life-blood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Altar-steps are stained.<br />
<a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>The poor
arose right bravely,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their much-loved Monks to aid,<br />
And many thus right gladly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their lives a forfeit made.<br />
Now having done all thoroughly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their work of cruel wrong,<br />
They left the Island weeping,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All hushed the Holy Song,<br />
Which for so many ages,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By night as well as day,<br />
Had praised the Love of Jesus,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In one long ceaseless lay.<br />
And now the poor are seeking,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the ruins drear,<br />
The bodies of the Martyrs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So holy, and so dear.<br />
Ah! there before the Altar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The brave old Abbot lies;<br />
And there, too, Father Rudolph,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With fixed and glassy eyes.<br />
<a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>But oh! a
calm serenest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Enfolds the Martyrs blest,<br />
Strange joy lights up their faces,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their spirits are at rest.<br />
The dear old Abbey crumbles<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All swiftly to decay:<br />
Oh! for its restoration!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cadfan! Dubritius! pray!<br />
Ye thousand Saints of Bardsey,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lift up your pleading song,<br />
That Jesus may avenge you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of this most cruel wrong!</p>

<p class="poetry">A hundred years are over,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Two stranger pilgrims steal,<br />
To Bardsey&rsquo;s Abbey ruins,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To pray for Bardsey&rsquo;s weal.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; No moonlight&rsquo;s silver ray<br />

desolation<br />

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
